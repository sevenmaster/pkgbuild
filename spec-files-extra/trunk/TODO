usage: no ChangeLog for this TODO file needed. Just edit and commit with a very short note, e.g. solved 2) short_issue, added 5) pnm for perl5.x.x

1)
SFEhplip.spec: pnm_macros for SFEcups/SUNWcups, SFEsane-backends/SUNWsanebackends/SUNWsanebackendu, eventually python version macro 2.4/2.6

2)
SFErsnapshot.spec: pnm_macros for SUNWsshu

3)
SFEp7zip.spec: check saprc build, especially enianness (old patch p7zip-01-makefile.diff)


4)
all spec files using renamed / removed / added packages: search for packages
which can make use of pnm_macros by:
for package in openssl gnu-dbm gdbm pigment libmikmod fftw4 sane-backend system/header sfwhea$ hea$ ghostscript Gtk wget gtk1 python26 python-gnome-libs perl5
  do
  egrep -n "^Requires.* (/|SUNW|SFE).*$package" *spec base-specs/*spec experimental/*spec
  done
notes: with perl5 you might need to change other paths in the spec as well

5)
write pnm_macros to get perl584 or perl510 or other future versions properly (Build)Required or paths like /usr/perl5/vendor_perl/5[.8.4|.10|...) properly setup
20110618 update: basic functionality is now there, please test your personal SFEperl-<module> now (Osol134, OI, S11Express)

6)
once Solaris 11 Express build is out delivering a new perl version, check + adjust
the build-number and remove corresponding ##TODO## in include/packagenames.define.allbuilds.inc

7)
need one general license file for "perl" licensed packages. all specs can point to that file with SUNW_Copyright:

8)
add to SFEperl-* modules hierarchical package names as well. maintain old short SVR4 name as package alias.
see experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl to get an idea about what the hierarchical package name might be.

9)
see if SFEgcc can avoid forcing the linker to be the gnu ld. suggested by richlowe is https://github.com/mirrors/gcc/commit/ce72f71213f2d4c75e3e82b6524e477d0e743ec5 
this would enable sun ld even on OI147.
check if this fix is already in the %version of gcc we have now (4.5.3).

10)
think on _default macro to point to Python 2.4 or 2.6 or whatever future version is in a Distribution
pnm_buildrequires_perl_default requires_perl_default      (early stage, testing)
pnm_buildrequires_python_default requires_python_default  (not yet there, which other parameters needed)

11)
SFEstellarium-gpp.spec ### NOTE ### (Alex Viskovatoff>
 ###
 ### The only way I can get this to link successfully is to remove
 ### libgcc_s.so* and libstdc++.* from /usr/sfw/lib while building.

12)
gnu style find. think on a pnm_macro to get this into /usr/gnu/bin/ dependent on the
distro and osbuild (use case is e.g. SFExerces-c-gpp.spec/SFExerxes-c.spec base-specs/xerces-c.spec)


13)
verify this usage hint: if C++ libraries are to be placed in other _basedir:
It might be that _basedir=/usr/g++ is on some cases not set early enough or in the wrong order.
Only _prefix get's set, except you again include base.inc like that
%include Solaris.inc
%define _basedir /usr/g++
%include base.inc
/usr/g++/bin
/usr/g++/lib.
...

14)
re-visit dependencies on other perl modules and make them (Build)Requires in those spec files: SFEperl-net-dns.spec SFEperl-mail-spf.spec

15)
check dependencies on SFEgcc* for SFEkchmviewer.spec, ...

16)
make up a file or a wiki page with current notes like "deprecated" and "recommeded"
collect topics here:
  deprecated: CC=gcc   recommended: CC=/usr/gnu/bin/gcc  or CC=/usr/sfw/bin/gcc (reason: on fresh builds PATH=/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/gnu/bin gets you the gcc-3.x.x version *unwanted*)

  recommended: use in all FLAGS the macros:  CFLAGS="%{_optflags}" LDFLAGS=...  CXXFLAGS=... (reason: a lot)

  deprecated: use of build specifiy package names. recommended: use of packagenamemacros.inc (reason: perl-584/perl-510/SUNWperl584core -> different directories vendor_perl/<5.8.4|5.10|5.12.3>

17)
SFEqt47-gpp.spec:
searching idea how to dynamicly start vncserver and later on explicitly kill this instand. shoul dnot interfere with other vncserver already running on this system (mind: non-global-zones as well)


18)
packagenamemacros.inc - maybe add a rule for libpng14 (older builds don't have that new version, may need SFE png as replacement)

19)
commit files delete in gmpc-plugins/ which already have moved into trunk/
