usage: no ChangeLog for this TODO file needed. Just edit and commit with a very short note, e.g. solved 2) short_issue, added 5) pnm for perl5.x.x

*YOU* do this:  svn up TODO, make your changes, then immediately commit with 
    echo "TODO: added 67) headsup-mini-description" | svn commit -F - TODO



*Is this you* whom can pick up an issue and think on a good solution for them.

Some are low hanging fruit, some not. You may choose to read from bottom up.




1)
SFEhplip.spec: pnm_macros for SFEcups/SUNWcups, SFEsane-backends/SUNWsanebackends/SUNWsanebackendu, eventually python version macro 2.4/2.6
SFExmlto.spec: add pnm_macros for docbook

2)
SFErsnapshot.spec: pnm_macros for SUNWsshu
SFEsmf-grey.spec:  pnm_macros for SUNWsndm* / sendmail
SFEwine.spec: pnm_macros for audio headers
SFEsamba35.spec/*: pnm_macro for SUNWbash or remove and say its core

#
#3)
#SFEp7zip.spec: check SPARC build, especially enianness (old patch p7zip-01-makefile.diff)
#
# DONE: Fixed for 7-Zip v9.20.1
# 

4)
all spec files using renamed / removed / added packages: search for packages
which can make use of pnm_macros by:
for package in openssl gnu-dbm gdbm pigment libmikmod fftw4 sane-backend system/header sfwhea$ hea$ ghostscript Gtk wget gtk1 python26 python-gnome-libs perl5
  do
  egrep -n "^Requires.* (/|SUNW|SFE).*$package" *spec base-specs/*spec experimental/*spec
  done
notes: with perl5 you might need to change other paths in the spec as well

##DONE##5)
##DONE##write pnm_macros to get perl584 or perl510 or other future versions properly (Build)Required or paths like /usr/perl5/vendor_perl/5[.8.4|.10|...) properly setup
##DONE##20110618 update: basic functionality is now there, please test your personal SFEperl-<module> now (Osol134, OI, S11Express)

6)
#updated once Solaris 11 Express build is out delivering a new perl version, check + adjust
#updated the build-number and remove corresponding ##TODO## in include/packagenames.define.allbuilds.inc
testing now Solaris 11 (Express) Build >= 166 to use perl-512
#note: pnm_macros already implement this since June 17th 2011. Use the pnm_macro for perl (pnm_buildrequires_perl_default, pnm_requires_perl_default, ...)


7)
need one general license file for "perl" licensed packages. all specs can point to that file with SUNW_Copyright:

8)
add to SFEperl-* modules hierarchical package names as well. maintain old short SVR4 name as package alias.
see experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl to get an idea about what the hierarchical package name might be.

8b)
let experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl find licenses in various places (Makefile.PL, website, cpan,...)
and add copyright files to copyright/ . In case license is same as with perl, we might point to
always the same combined license file of current perl version (artitisc combined with the gpl(n) license),
e.g. copyright/perl-license.copyright.
Some modules simply write smth like "same license as perl", keyword is "perl" in e.g. Makefile.PL

8c)
experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl find in META.yml which other perl modules
are required to run this module, find out package names and add this to
(Build)Requires. May exclude those perl modules delivered on exactly that OS revision.
Might need special handling if OS revisions differ in number of delivered perl modules -> 
 may need adding pnm_macros or other solution
gegrep -iA7 quire BUILD/SFEperl-razor-agents-5.10.0.2.84/razor-agents-2.84/META.yml

8d)
experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl find a way to detect if "Build.PL" is to be
used for building _or_ Mailefile.PL.
Put the right method into newly generated spec files


9)
lengthy+high_quality description: http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2010-01/msg01300.html
and maybe
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/111431

see if SFEgcc can avoid forcing the linker to be the gnu ld. suggested by richlowe is https://github.com/mirrors/gcc/commit/ce72f71213f2d4c75e3e82b6524e477d0e743ec5 
this would enable sun ld even on OI147.
check if this fix is already in the %version of gcc we have now (4.5.3).
#edit by kenmays: Solaris x86, use sun ld and GNU as combo.

SFEstellarium-gpp.spec ### NOTE ### (Alex Viskovatoff>
 ###
 ### The only way I can get this to link successfully is to remove
 ### libgcc_s.so* and libstdc++.* from /usr/sfw/lib while building.

12)
gnu style find. think on a pnm_macro to get this into /usr/gnu/bin/ dependent on the
distro and osbuild (use case is e.g. SFExerces-c-gpp.spec/SFExerxes-c.spec base-specs/xerces-c.spec)


13)
verify this usage hint: if C++ libraries are to be placed in other _basedir:
It might be that _basedir=/usr/g++ is on some cases not set early enough or in the wrong order.
Only _prefix get's set, except you again include base.inc like that
%include Solaris.inc
%define _basedir /usr/g++
%include base.inc
/usr/g++/bin
/usr/g++/lib.
...

14)
re-visit dependencies on other perl modules and make them (Build)Requires in those spec files: SFEperl-net-dns.spec SFEperl-mail-spf.spec

15) packages should record dependencies needed to work
check dependencies on SFEgcc* for SFEkchmviewer.spec, ...
check dependencies on "at least" the gcc runtime runtime-libraries. Programs 
and other libs may rely on e.g. SFEgccruntime and other libs.
*verify* that gcc-runtime-libraries are searched in the right place, /usr/gnu/,
if they are independent of the exact gcc-compiler version.

16)
make up a file or a wiki page with current notes like "deprecated" and "recommeded"
collect topics here:
  deprecated: CC=gcc   recommended: CC=/usr/gnu/bin/gcc  or CC=/usr/sfw/bin/gcc (reason: on fresh builds PATH=/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/gnu/bin gets you the gcc-3.x.x version *unwanted*)

  recommended: use in all FLAGS the macros:  CFLAGS="%{_optflags}" LDFLAGS=...  CXXFLAGS=... (reason: a lot)

  deprecated: use of build specifiy package names. recommended: use of packagenamemacros.inc (reason: perl-584/perl-510/SUNWperl584core -> different directories vendor_perl/<5.8.4|5.10|5.12.3>
Note 20121128: currently we use CC=gcc, but this might miss adding 
the package dependency on the _correct_ runtime library package.
So occationally it is gcc-3 or gcc-4 from SFE and the corresponding
runtime libs which is needed.

17)
SFEqt47-gpp.spec:
searching idea how to dynamicly start vncserver and later on explicitly kill this instand. shoul dnot interfere with other vncserver already running on this system (mind: non-global-zones as well)


18)
packagenamemacros.inc - maybe add a rule for libpng14 (older builds don't have that new version, may need SFE png as replacement)
packagenamemacros.inc - handle osbuild dependend to graphviz_default to be SUNWgraphviz or SFEgraphviz
packagenamemacros.inc - handle osbuild dependend to get OS libid3tag in /usr/lib or SFELibid3tag-gnu.spec in /usr/gnu/lib

19)
commit files delete in gmpc-plugins/ which already have moved into trunk/

20)
implement a compiler check on gcc being gcc 4.x.x and not old gcc 3.x.x . Could be placed in a central include file.
prevent users from accidentially using /usr/gnu/bin/gcc being 3.x.x instead of 4.x.x .

21)
think on include files modeled after usr-gnu.in to define library variants (g++/SunStudio, stdcxx, stdc++, ...)
names could be usr-stdcxx.inc, usr-stdc++.inc, usr-stlport4.inc, usr-g++.inc
note: should eliminate the old path /%_prefix/lib/g++/%_gpp_version
note: might need changes in the regular include files as well (think hard before changing them)
make usage note on the wiki and enter wiki url into the include file

22)
package wish list
SFEmpack (see spec-files-jucr/specs/mpack.spec, clear dependencies)  #easy-jucr
SFEcalibre.spec or SFECoolReader.spec  (herzen?)

23)
check dependencies on mysql for SFEfreeradius.spec (pnm_macros? somthing like pnm_mysql_default)

24)
pkgbuild.wiki.sourcefore.net: add implementation note for SFE maintainers to 
check the search order be /usr/g++/lib then all others like /usr/lib and /usr/gnu/lib

25)
add helper script to do this at the end of a pkgtool run as the last line in 
section %install: use env info and read 
/var/tmp/pkgbuild-$LOGNAME/<packagename>/*all*those*files*and*dirs*
print-out a nice %files section with all the well-known-defaults which can then
be included into the new spec file with the previously empty %files section.
The user just re-runs the pkgbuild --short-circuit -bb SFEpackagename to see 
if files are nicely catched. Eliminates / reduced the great try+error cycles
when defining %files
eventually "pkg" has a nice list of defaults in the code, else assemble from
man filesystem or existing spec files

26)
SFEqt-gpp.spec - test QT itself for working properly (low priority)
- re-visit package dependency with check-deps, add (Build)Requires if needed 
- examine runtime library paths created by patched/unpached SFEgcc, especially
  /usr/g++/lib appearing early - just to be sure (med priority)

29)
Requires: SUNWgnome-python26-libs - check if this could be done similar to 
pnm_python_default. Could be used by SFEpessulus.spec and possibly others
SFEpygoocanvas.spec SFEsabayon.spec SFEmanifold.spec
Find a better way to express e.g.  %{pnm_buildrequires_SUNWgnome_python26_libs_devel}
as this is a "renamed=true" package on newer osdistro, so pkgtool can't see
them installed.

30)
SFEtransmageddon.spec: use pnm_python_default  and *test* if it works
SFEpython26-mpd.spec: remove hard definitions to python version, eventually create IPS_Package_Name from macro

#resolved# 31)
#resolved# SFEqt-gpp.spec -> Qt*pc wrong setting mysql: Libs.private: -L/usr/gnu/lib -L/usr/g++/{mysql/5.1/lib}  ...

32)
check in S11 and OI which packages got added with S11 Updates and with OI151a<n>
and create pnm_macro rules to simplify (Build)Requires in the consuming spec-files
check for identical/alias packages in SFE which have similar *new* packages in 
SUNW, create pnm_macro rules for them. 
Those packages below are known to have a good replacement in the distro: 
(else: relocate ours to /usr/gnu. "not:" to collect replacements not usable for SFE)
#osdistro number to be included here if known!
SFEaalib (1.4.0 1.4rc5) SUNWaalib library/aalib@1.4.5

not: OI gcc 4.4  (missing LINK_LIBGCC_SPEC, not versioned package and directory layout)
not: S11 gcc 4.x (missing LINK_LIBGCC_SPEC, not versioned package and directory layout)

#some osdistro have editline, some don't. Use SFEeditline.spec if necessary
editline

33)
pkgbuild.wiki: Review lonely pages in draft status and enhance them, link them:
https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pkgbuild/index.php?title=Special:LonelyPages

34)
bug: %define _gpp is used to find the right runtime libs, this is pointing to 
non-existing directory in some cases
include/base.inc, include/arch64.inc, %if cc_is_gcc equals 1
 %define _gpp_version %(%{?_gpp:%_gpp}%{!?_gpp:g++} --version | head -1 | cut -f3 -d' ')
 %define _cxx_libdir        %{_prefix}/lib/g++/%{_gpp_version}
checks: _prefix can be set to /usr or to /usr/gnu .
our g++ lives for gcc 3.x in place A and for SFEgcc 4.x.x in place B

35)
reverse SFEgccruntime and SFEgcc to make pkgtool --autodeps find the spec file providing the runtime
remove intermediate symlink SFEgccruntime.spec -> SFEgcc.spec

36)

37) 
Update: 20130113 currently working on this: tomww (see experimental/SFEphp54.spec)
overhaul SFEphp*spec. base pacakge and extensions, get base and extensions in 
sync, version bump, use pnm_macros ( change database/postgres-90/library, 
database/postgres-90/developer SUNWphp52r SUNWphp52u ) Note: postgres base
package name and spec-filename should read: SFE or SUNWpostgr-90 like the
older versions did. IPS name set with IPS_package_name: database/postgres-90 ... )

38)
postgres*.spec make SVR4 ready (Solaris 10) and provide IPS package names
with IPS_package_name: database/postgres-90 ... 
would it make sense to keep subpackages in sync with SUNWpostgr-84(-****) ?
use pnm_macros for dependencies which aren't recoded with legacy
SUNWpackagename in IPS repositories of OI or Solaris 11 (Express)

39)
make new SFElv2.spec http://lv2plug.in http://lv2plug.in/spec/
make new SFElv2-swh-plugins.spec - find tarball / calculate package version
     number from e.g. git checkout_number. use e.g. 0.0.<calced_number>   https://github.com/swh/lv2

40)
test some stacks of spec files with the SFEgcc-runpath.spec experimental compiler,
this should result in gcc compiled packages using libgcc_s.so.1 and libstdc++.so.6
from /usr/gcc/4.6/lib/* or fallback shared directory /usr/gcc/lib
dump -Lv <binary|library.so.n> print RUNPATH /usr/gcc/4.6/lib:/usr/gcc/lib first
ldd <binary|library.so.n> no unresolved dependencies on libs and gcc runtime from /usr/gcc/4.6/lib

41)
check if those package should better go to /usr/gnu, remember checking other packages
to still find those packages in the new location:
SFEwxwidgets: The following packages all deliver file actions to usr/include/wx-2.8/wx/dir.h:

49)
change SFEfuse-exfat.spec to _really_ use libfuse form /usr/gnu and not from            
outdated older libfuse or the S11 provided libfuse (might not work)

Solution should be then to relocate that file and rename it as well to avoid
filename conflicts if the OS itself provides that file also

53)
maybe change livemedia version number detection to an autoupdate_but_stored_in_svn variant
that way you can rely on the svn revision be in sync with the consuming spec files and 
not get upgrdes accidentially at compile time
Could use a explicit version number of livemedia as dependency on the consuming packages.
e.g. compiled against livemedia 2014.12.17, so consuming packages get a pkg mogrify to
require explicitly livemedia@2014.12.17 or livemedia@2014.3.25,5.11-0.0.175.2.0.0.34.0:20140413T011859Z
pkgtool does provide a mechanism to provide a version number (exact)?
one could query the livemedia complete version string at compile time of 
a dependent package, put that livemediaipspackageversion into a variable and
write Requires: livemedia = %{livemediaipspackageversion}

54)
find a solution for more fresh distroy carry a SUNWbdb including the header file (was 
missing in older OS builds, bdb 4.x) and version 5.x 
maybe move SFEbdb to usr-gnu.inc and only use in special cases
consuming spec files may need something like pnm_bdb_default
#suggested (kenmays): Use database/berkeleydb-5@5.1.25 or bdb 5.3.21 package as
#                     a comparable solution for SFEbdb (4.8.30).

55)
make pnm_macro for perl module io-compress (zlib), perl 5.10.x may start including that

S11 175.0.0.4       osbuild 175     sub-build is 0  SRU is 4
details:
maybe prepare a variable like "ips_pkg_entire_version" for use in spec-files
Add S12 to the osbuild logic
write examples on how to distinguish osbuild in different distros,
e.g. S12 osbuild 24 is newer then and different from S11 osbuild 175

59)
distinguish provided JDK and/or openjdk.
spec file then require just (macro names are subject to change)
   "jdk_default"
   "jdk16_default"
   "jdk17_default"
   "openjdk_default"
   "openjdk7_default"
   "openjdk8_default" 
and get what is needed for the spec file.
we coul dstart with this switching logic:
> > OI:
> >   generic java macro -> SFEopenjdk7
> >   java7 macro -> SFEopenjdk8
> >
> > S11:
> >   generic java macro -> os provided default
> >   java7 macro -> os available but not default jdk7

Note: partly inplemented, you can use (example for SUNWj6*)

Review Boost.Locale security notice (Boost #7743)

61) 
Review C++11 decltype keyword support for GCC 4.6.3/4.7.2 (N3276)

62)

SFEfile             OK     missing

63)
check which osbuild need updated "expat" to get "xmlparse.h" header file (SFEaudacity.spec)

64)
update xgettext to new version, re-enable --package-name= in audacity

65)
boost 1.53.0 doesn't compile in SFEboost-stdcx.spec version (1.49.0 does)

66) 
Update README file in svn to point users to: wiki, buildinstructions, 
mailinglists, IRC channel and on how to ask for help and participate in SFE

67)
spec files currently broken or in need for investigation
what:                   where:
see why checks fail	SFElibmpc.spec, base-specs/libmpc.spec: disabled make checks, needs investigation
gtkdoc XML errors	SFEgtkimageview.spec - currently disabled building docs (S11.2), verify different osdistro

68)
check if those packages work with SFEqt4, if yes, move them to SFEqt4(-stdcxx), then retire SFEqt3(-stdcxx):
SFEstellarium.spec:Requires: SFEqt-stdcxx
SFEtea.spec:Requires: SFEqt-stdcxx
SFEvidalia.spec:Requires:       SFEqt-stdcxx
encumbered/SFEarts.spec:Requires: SFEqt3

make pnm default macro for ruby, including path names
pnm_buildrequires_ruby_default requires_ruby_default 
optional:
pnm_buildrequires_ruby18_default packagename_SFEruby-18_or_SUNWruby18
pnm_buildrequires_ruby19_default packagename_SFEruby_or_SUNWruby19

72)
clean up SFEruby.spec and SFEruby-18.spec (patched replacement for osdistro ruby)
to match the layout as osdistro ruby uses. Look at the build sources of e.g. OSOL.
This enables multi-version installations for ruby (say you can have 1.8 and 1.9 and
x.y installed at the same time, only specify one as the system default by 
configuring the mediated symlinks)
below: sfe/runtime/ruby-18 and runtime/ruby-19 can't be installed at the same time
 pkg search -r libruby.so
INDEX      ACTION VALUE                       PACKAGE
basename   link   usr/lib/libruby.so          pkg:/sfe/runtime/ruby-18@1.8.7.371-0.11.0
basename   link   usr/lib/libruby.so          pkg:/runtime/ruby-19@1.9.3-0.11.0
basename   link   usr/ruby/1.8/lib/libruby.so pkg:/runtime/ruby-18@1.8.7.334-0.175.0.0.0.2.537

73)
make a script which searches for files shared between SFE IPS repos and different
versions of a Operating System IPS repository. To be used for finding conflicting
files *early* and before a OS upgrade happens.

74)
re-visit this change:  svn diff -r 4965:5412  SFElibx264.spec
it disables isaexec, should be enabled. why "cp" instead of "hardlink" to isaexec?

75)
-z now for gcc_s | RTLD_NOW in elf header

76)
make pkg operations resistant against locks, failures, ... instead
of just failing the while package!

77)
create include file for local preferences, empty, never changed.
if users wants a default selection of features, place
the setting into the preferences file.
examples:
no_build_renamed_packages
mplayer2_slimbuild

78)
think on reversing the default for l10n subpackages.
current: don't build l10n (only if a spec file honours that switch), but endusers usually want them by default
future: build them by default, developers may switch them off to save time

79)
try to name separate "header" packages in IPS as "developer/*" instead "*/header"
SFEqt.spec
SFEqt-gpp.spec      done (rev 5541)
SFEqt-stdcxx.spec
SFEboost-gpp.spec
SFEboost-stdcxx.spec

80)
add handy macros %{gpp_inc} %{gpp_lib} %{gpp_lib_path} in case the spec file
does not %include usr-g++.inc but needs to find the g++ libs in /usr/g++/<include|lib>

81)
add profile to support SFEfail2ban.spec

62) 
make a quality check script: detect if pkgdepend put a "require-any" into a package, that needs to be removed and only our package is allowed to stay (e.g. same lib name present in /usr/lib and in /usr/g++/lib or /usr/gnu/lib and so on)

63)
crate start menue entries for:
SFEtransmission.spec
SFEperl-mime-base64

64)
for older perl 5.8.4 some spec files need a fresh SFEperl-extutils-makemaker.spec
so make the BuildRequires dependent on the provided perl version / osdistro
and set the PERL5LIB variable
SFEperl-date-manip.spec
SFEperl-html-template.spec

65)
create a tool which asks the various pkg servers about presence of specific
package names and version. Should help finding the osbuild and osdistro
which provides a packages and when the SFE variant is usefull.
(e.g. os provides old version or no version, SFE provides a gcc built C++
variant and so on)

66)
create auto-update service for geoip database
e.g. updating the database once a quater year

67)
(brought up by alp: libevent / libevent2 event-config.h differs when compiled 32- or 64-bit)
(tom68) patch usr/include/event-config.h to recognize if it is consumed as 32- or 64-bit
-#define _EVENT_SIZEOF_LONG 4
+#define _EVENT_SIZEOF_LONG 8
Idea: JT-EC> We just wrap the headers in #if (defined (__x86_64__)) #else like opensslconf.h

68)
micro tasks for getting more packages compile on OmniOS:
un-archive SFEgdbm.spec (OmniOS has no)

67)
pnm_macros needed to switch package name if the old package is now renamd_to
pnm_macro to resolve pnm_buildrequires_SUNWprd_devel to library/nspr if osdistro >=160 (S11, probably others as well)

68)
packages missing badly on OmniOS and we don't want to pull from other repositories
name		who works on it - comments and ideas
aprutil		done - missing: dual 32/64-build for 64-bit projects
libapr		done - missing: dual 32/64-build for 64-bit projects
gdbm		done (commited with rev TBD))
svn subversion	done
apache2 series  no one, good examples available
php5 series     no one, good examples available
neon-gnu	no one, could build a sub-package only on OM to replace missing osdistro neon but use symlinks to /usr/gnu

69)
SFEmunin.spec needs library/perl-5/net-ssleay bit this varies on osdistro very much

70)

72)
adjust pnm_default macros for S11, S12 (uses mediators for java jre and jdk)
if %{pnm_requires_java_runtime_default} is used, does this play well with pkg mediator java?
we need sometimes as BuildRequires the Java JDK and at runtime it is enought to require the JRE
we could enter the mediator package if we don't care about the java version
if we care about the java version, we need a way to require the corresponding package and
maybe set the correct JAVA_HOME to find this version (if other versions are installed too)
provide a pnm_macro to set the JDK JAVA_HOME (to reach $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac)
and another pnm_macro to set the JRE JAVA_HOME (to reach $JAVA_HOME/bin/java of the specified platform default version)
and another pnm_macro to set the JRE in explicit version (to reach jre_this_version/bin/java of the specified explicit version)
