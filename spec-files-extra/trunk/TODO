usage: no ChangeLog for this TODO file needed. Just edit and commit with a very short note, e.g. solved 2) short_issue, added 5) pnm for perl5.x.x

*YOU* do this:  svn up TODO, make your changes, then immediately commit with 
    echo "TODO: added 67) headsup-mini-description" | svn commit -F - TODO



*Is this you* whom can pick up an issue and think on a good solution for them.

Some are low hanging fruit, some not. You may choose to read from bottom up.




1)
SFEhplip.spec: pnm_macros for SFEcups/SUNWcups, SFEsane-backends/SUNWsanebackends/SUNWsanebackendu, eventually python version macro 2.4/2.6
SFExmlto.spec: add pnm_macros for docbook

2)
SFErsnapshot.spec: pnm_macros for SUNWsshu
SFEsmf-grey.spec:  pnm_macros for SUNWsndm* / sendmail
SFEwine.spec: pnm_macros for audio headers

#
#3)
#SFEp7zip.spec: check SPARC build, especially enianness (old patch p7zip-01-makefile.diff)
#
# DONE: Fixed for 7-Zip v9.20.1
# 

4)
all spec files using renamed / removed / added packages: search for packages
which can make use of pnm_macros by:
for package in openssl gnu-dbm gdbm pigment libmikmod fftw4 sane-backend system/header sfwhea$ hea$ ghostscript Gtk wget gtk1 python26 python-gnome-libs perl5
  do
  egrep -n "^Requires.* (/|SUNW|SFE).*$package" *spec base-specs/*spec experimental/*spec
  done
notes: with perl5 you might need to change other paths in the spec as well

##DONE##5)
##DONE##write pnm_macros to get perl584 or perl510 or other future versions properly (Build)Required or paths like /usr/perl5/vendor_perl/5[.8.4|.10|...) properly setup
##DONE##20110618 update: basic functionality is now there, please test your personal SFEperl-<module> now (Osol134, OI, S11Express)

6)
#updated once Solaris 11 Express build is out delivering a new perl version, check + adjust
#updated the build-number and remove corresponding ##TODO## in include/packagenames.define.allbuilds.inc
testing now Solaris 11 (Express) Build >= 166 to use perl-512
#note: pnm_macros already implement this since June 17th 2011. Use the pnm_macro for perl (pnm_buildrequires_perl_default, pnm_requires_perl_default, ...)


7)
need one general license file for "perl" licensed packages. all specs can point to that file with SUNW_Copyright:

8)
add to SFEperl-* modules hierarchical package names as well. maintain old short SVR4 name as package alias.
see experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl to get an idea about what the hierarchical package name might be.

8b)
let experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl find licenses in various places (Makefile.PL, website, cpan,...)
and add copyright files to copyright/ . In case license is same as with perl, we might point to
always the same combined license file of current perl version (artitisc combined with the gpl(n) license),
e.g. copyright/perl-license.copyright.
Some modules simply write smth like "same license as perl", keyword is "perl" in e.g. Makefile.PL

8c)
experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl find in META.yml which other perl modules
are required to run this module, find out package names and add this to
(Build)Requires. May exclude those perl modules delivered on exactly that OS revision.
Might need special handling if OS revisions differ in number of delivered perl modules -> 
 may need adding pnm_macros or other solution
gegrep -iA7 quire BUILD/SFEperl-razor-agents-5.10.0.2.84/razor-agents-2.84/META.yml
requires:
    Digest::SHA1:                  0

    Time::HiRes:                   0

8d)
experimental/make_perl_cpan_settings.pl find a way to detect if "Build.PL" is to be
used for building _or_ Mailefile.PL.
Put the right method into newly generated spec files


9)
lengthy+high_quality description: http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2010-01/msg01300.html
and maybe
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/111431

see if SFEgcc can avoid forcing the linker to be the gnu ld. suggested by richlowe is https://github.com/mirrors/gcc/commit/ce72f71213f2d4c75e3e82b6524e477d0e743ec5 
this would enable sun ld even on OI147.
check if this fix is already in the %version of gcc we have now (4.5.3).
#edit by kenmays: Solaris x86, use sun ld and GNU as combo.

##DONE##10)

SFEstellarium-gpp.spec ### NOTE ### (Alex Viskovatoff>
 ###
 ### The only way I can get this to link successfully is to remove
 ### libgcc_s.so* and libstdc++.* from /usr/sfw/lib while building.

12)
gnu style find. think on a pnm_macro to get this into /usr/gnu/bin/ dependent on the
distro and osbuild (use case is e.g. SFExerces-c-gpp.spec/SFExerxes-c.spec base-specs/xerces-c.spec)


13)
verify this usage hint: if C++ libraries are to be placed in other _basedir:
It might be that _basedir=/usr/g++ is on some cases not set early enough or in the wrong order.
Only _prefix get's set, except you again include base.inc like that
%include Solaris.inc
%define _basedir /usr/g++
%include base.inc
/usr/g++/bin
/usr/g++/lib.
...

14)
re-visit dependencies on other perl modules and make them (Build)Requires in those spec files: SFEperl-net-dns.spec SFEperl-mail-spf.spec

15) packages should record dependencies needed to work
check dependencies on SFEgcc* for SFEkchmviewer.spec, ...
check dependencies on "at least" the gcc runtime runtime-libraries. Programs 
and other libs may rely on e.g. SFEgccruntime and other libs.
*verify* that gcc-runtime-libraries are searched in the right place, /usr/gnu/,
if they are independent of the exact gcc-compiler version.

16)
make up a file or a wiki page with current notes like "deprecated" and "recommeded"
collect topics here:
  deprecated: CC=gcc   recommended: CC=/usr/gnu/bin/gcc  or CC=/usr/sfw/bin/gcc (reason: on fresh builds PATH=/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/gnu/bin gets you the gcc-3.x.x version *unwanted*)

  recommended: use in all FLAGS the macros:  CFLAGS="%{_optflags}" LDFLAGS=...  CXXFLAGS=... (reason: a lot)

  deprecated: use of build specifiy package names. recommended: use of packagenamemacros.inc (reason: perl-584/perl-510/SUNWperl584core -> different directories vendor_perl/<5.8.4|5.10|5.12.3>
Note 20121128: currently we use CC=gcc, but this might miss adding 
the package dependency on the _correct_ runtime library package.
So occationally it is gcc-3 or gcc-4 from SFE and the corresponding
runtime libs which is needed.

17)
SFEqt47-gpp.spec:
searching idea how to dynamicly start vncserver and later on explicitly kill this instand. shoul dnot interfere with other vncserver already running on this system (mind: non-global-zones as well)


18)
packagenamemacros.inc - maybe add a rule for libpng14 (older builds don't have that new version, may need SFE png as replacement)
packagenamemacros.inc - handle osbuild dependend to graphviz_default to be SUNWgraphviz or SFEgraphviz

19)
commit files delete in gmpc-plugins/ which already have moved into trunk/

20)
implement a compiler check on gcc being gcc 4.x.x and not old gcc 3.x.x . Could be placed in a central include file.
prevent users from accidentially using /usr/gnu/bin/gcc being 3.x.x instead of 4.x.x .

21)
think on include files modeled after usr-gnu.in to define library variants (g++/SunStudio, stdcxx, stdc++, ...)
names could be usr-stdcxx.inc, usr-stdc++.inc, usr-stlport4.inc, usr-g++.inc
note: should eliminate the old path /%_prefix/lib/g++/%_gpp_version
note: might need changes in the regular include files as well (think hard before changing them)
make usage note on the wiki and enter wiki url into the include file

22)
package wish list
SFEmpack (see spec-files-jucr/specs/mpack.spec, clear dependencies)  #easy-jucr
SFEcalibre.spec or SFECoolReader.spec  (herzen?)

23)
check dependencies on mysql for SFEfreeradius.spec (pnm_macros? somthing like pnm_mysql_default)

24)
pkgbuild.wiki.sourcefore.net: add implementation note for SFE maintainers to 
check the search order be /usr/g++/lib then all others like /usr/lib and /usr/gnu/lib

25)
add helper script to do this at the end of a pkgtool run as the last line in 
section %install: use env info and read 
/var/tmp/pkgbuild-$LOGNAME/<packagename>/*all*those*files*and*dirs*
print-out a nice %files section with all the well-known-defaults which can then
be included into the new spec file with the previously empty %files section.
The user just re-runs the pkgbuild --short-circuit -bb SFEpackagename to see 
if files are nicely catched. Eliminates / reduced the great try+error cycles
when defining %files
eventually "pkg" has a nice list of defaults in the code, else assemble from
man filesystem or existing spec files

26)
SFEqt-gpp.spec - test QT itself for working properly (low priority)
- re-visit package dependency with check-deps, add (Build)Requires if needed 
- examine runtime library paths created by patched/unpached SFEgcc, especially
  /usr/g++/lib appearing early - just to be sure (med priority)

29)
Requires: SUNWgnome-python26-libs - check if this could be done similar to 
pnm_python_default. Could be used by SFEpessulus.spec and possibly others
SFEpygoocanvas.spec SFEsabayon.spec

30)
SFEtransmageddon.spec: use pnm_python_default  and *test* if it works

#resolved# 31)
#resolved# SFEqt-gpp.spec -> Qt*pc wrong setting mysql: Libs.private: -L/usr/gnu/lib -L/usr/g++/{mysql/5.1/lib}  ...

32)
check in S11 and OI which packages got added with S11 Updates and with OI151a<n>
and create pnm_macro rules to simplify (Build)Requires in the consuming spec-files
check for identical/alias packages in SFE which have similar *new* packages in 
SUNW, create pnm_macro rules for them. 
Those packages below are known to have a good replacement in the distro: 
(else: relocate ours to /usr/gnu. "not:" to collect replacements not usable for SFE)
#osdistro number to be included here if known!
SFEaalib (1.4.0 1.4rc5) SUNWaalib library/aalib@1.4.5

not: OI gcc 4.4  (missing LINK_LIBGCC_SPEC, not versioned package and directory layout)
not: S11 gcc 4.x (missing LINK_LIBGCC_SPEC, not versioned package and directory layout)

#some osdistro have editline, some don't. Use SFEeditline.spec if necessary
editline

33)
pkgbuild.wiki: Review lonely pages in draft status and enhance them, link them:
https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pkgbuild/index.php?title=Special:LonelyPages

34)
bug: %define _gpp is used to find the right runtime libs, this is pointing to 
non-existing directory in some cases
include/base.inc, include/arch64.inc, %if cc_is_gcc equals 1
 %define _gpp_version %(%{?_gpp:%_gpp}%{!?_gpp:g++} --version | head -1 | cut -f3 -d' ')
 %define _cxx_libdir        %{_prefix}/lib/g++/%{_gpp_version}
checks: _prefix can be set to /usr or to /usr/gnu .
our g++ lives for gcc 3.x in place A and for SFEgcc 4.x.x in place B

35)
reverse SFEgccruntime and SFEgcc to make pkgtool --autodeps find the spec file providing the runtime
remove intermediate symlink SFEgccruntime.spec -> SFEgcc.spec

36)
make these spec files dual 32/64 bit:
  SFEqt-gpp (cost: somewhat larger)  (owner:  TBD, volunteers?)
 
37) 
Update: 20130113 currently working on this: tomww (see experimental/SFEphp54.spec)
overhaul SFEphp*spec. base pacakge and extensions, get base and extensions in 
sync, version bump, use pnm_macros ( change database/postgres-90/library, 
database/postgres-90/developer SUNWphp52r SUNWphp52u ) Note: postgres base
package name and spec-filename should read: SFE or SUNWpostgr-90 like the
older versions did. IPS name set with IPS_package_name: database/postgres-90 ... )

38)
postgres*.spec make SVR4 ready (Solaris 10) and provide IPS package names
with IPS_package_name: database/postgres-90 ... 
would it make sense to keep subpackages in sync with SUNWpostgr-84(-****) ?
use pnm_macros for dependencies which aren't recoded with legacy
SUNWpackagename in IPS repositories of OI or Solaris 11 (Express)

39)
make new SFElv2.spec http://lv2plug.in http://lv2plug.in/spec/
make new SFElv2-swh-plugins.spec - find tarball / calculate package version
     number from e.g. git checkout_number. use e.g. 0.0.<calced_number>   https://github.com/swh/lv2

40)
test some stacks of spec files with the SFEgcc-runpath.spec experimental compiler,
this should result in gcc compiled packages using libgcc_s.so.1 and libstdc++.so.6
from /usr/gcc/4.6/lib/* or fallback shared directory /usr/gcc/lib
dump -Lv <binary|library.so.n> print RUNPATH /usr/gcc/4.6/lib:/usr/gcc/lib first
ldd <binary|library.so.n> no unresolved dependencies on libs and gcc runtime from /usr/gcc/4.6/lib

41)
check if those package should better go to /usr/gnu, remember checking other packages
to still find those packages in the new location:
SFEwxwidgets: The following packages all deliver file actions to usr/include/wx-2.8/wx/dir.h:
  pkg://localhost/SFEwxwidgets@2.8.10,5.11-0.170:20110921T212701Z

make css a dependency in vlc
add "easy-rsa2 scripts to openvpn package (convenient and common way to generte certificates)

44)
verify that nvidia package does not change compile results of packages. If it doesn't,
deprecate adding Requires: nvidia. It can be set as BuildRequires: if that changes
the resulting package in an imporant way. Examples: ffmpeg compiles with nvidia
package present or absend, binary compare and/or functional and/or performance comparison.

45)
check those package names SVR4 and IPS for always lowercase (and spec file filenames)
Update new names in (Build)Requires of other spec files as well
SFEXaw3d
(search for more)

46)
set categories for all packages (at least for those which alread have IPS_package_names)
search for example packages with more then one category, to have multi-purpose packages
appear in all relevant category displays
package name                   category
xypackage                      xycategory-first
xypackage                      xycategory-second

48) duplicate files on more recent OS revisions
decide if the libs should more be moved to /usr/gnu/ _or_ if
a pnm_macro should be used to select the currently to be used
lib from the OS or from SFE. Examples in pnm_macro could be
SUNWgnu_dbm  versus SFEgdbm in include/packagenames.define.allbuilds.inc

49)
change SFEfuse-exfat.spec to _really_ use libfuse form /usr/gnu and not from
outdated older libfuse or the S11 provided libfuse (might not work)

50)
change existing /usr/gnu/ spec files to place xchat.desktop files *not* in
/usr/gnu/share/applications/ where is doesn't get the restart_fmri=svc:/application/desktop-cache/desktop-mime-cache:default
and it maybe doesn't read the file at all, so it is missing on the menu then!
Solution should be then to relocate that file and rename it as well to avoid
filename conflicts if the OS itself provides that file also
SFExchat.spec

51)

53)
maybe change livemedia version number detection to an autoupdate_but_stored_in_svn variant
that way you can rely on the svn revision be in sync with the consuming spec files and 
not get upgrdes accidentially at compile time

54)
find a solution for more fresh distroy carry a SUNWbdb including the header file (was 
missing in older OS builds, bdb 4.x) and version 5.x 
maybe move SFEbdb to usr-gnu.inc and only use in special cases
consuming spec files may need something like pnm_bdb_default
#suggested (kenmays): Use database/berkeleydb-5@5.1.25 or bdb 5.3.21 package as
#                     a comparable solution for SFEbdb (4.8.30).

55)
make pnm_macro for perl module io-compress (zlib), perl 5.10.x may start including that
module by default, so skip SFE version in that case an just require default perl as

need a way to distinguish sub-builds in osdistro.inc 
this helps switching in packagenamemacros and other
OS-version specific features
S11 175.0 -> 175.1  osbuild 175 but sub-build is 0 or 1
OI151a4 -> OI151a7  osbuild 151 but sub-build is 4 or 7
It should be as well possible to detect S11 SRUs 
SRUs:
S11 175.0.0.4       osbuild 175     sub-build is 0  SRU is 4
details:
maybe prepare a variable like "ips_pkg_entire_version" for use in spec-files
