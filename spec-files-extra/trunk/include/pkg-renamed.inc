##TODO## check added leading "0." for branch with different versions of pkgbuild!

# include file to help creating packages with the
# "renamed=true" flag in case a package name has
# changed.
# e.g. SFEurxvt               renamed to terminal/urxvt
# e.g. sfe/library/libsndfile renamed to sfe/library/gnu/libsndfile
#
# on pkg update  or  on pkg install terminal/urxvt  you get
# automaticly removed the old package name then installed the package newname.
# on pkg install oldname you automaticly get installed the  package newname.

#STRONG NOTE:
#remember to set in the new spec file the %action which
#adds the depend rule in the new package. The new
#package then requests the oldname package in a slightly 
#higher IPS_vendor_version (aka branch version) with
#the renamed=true tag in it. A depend rule requesting the
#newname package then puts the newname package into the
#plan while uninstalling the oldname package at that time.
#
#note: the ips_version_release_renamedbranch from this include
#file has the last number incremented by one.
#That makes the renamed package #always more fresh then any
#other regular oldname package.
#This tells IPS to upgrade the oldname package, that one
#has renamed=true in it and a dependency on the newname
#package to be installed.

# -> see SFEurxvt.spec for now

%changelog
* Wed Nov 14 2013 - Thomas Wagner
- fixed branch calculation
- fixed detection which renamed_<n> set is defined by the calling spec file
- split out section %package into extra include file, because it can't be wrapped
  by %if and must always be in the calling spec file
* Wed Nov 13 2013 - Thomas Wagner
- fix logic that checks if %{renamed_to_newnameversion_1} is set to a package name
- add calculation to get an always higher IPS_Vendor_version (aka branch) for the renamed=true package
- add suport for up to three old package names / %{renamed_to_newnameversion_2} and %{renamed_to_newnameversion_3}
* Sat Nov  9 2013 - Thomas Wagner
- initial include file
