# Stefan Teleman <stefan.teleman@oracle.com>
# The various ./configure's in GCC keep playing with CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS
# or CPPFLAGS, and this unsets LARGEFILE_SOURCE. THe result is that some
# GCC libraries are built with LARGEFILE_SOURCE enabled, and some don't.
# Make sure everything is built with LARGEFILE_SOURCE turned on.
# Internal patch. Not submitted upstream yet.
